Using htseq-count to output raw count matrix from aligned BAM file

1. Convert multiple BAM files into SAM using shell script

1.1 Create new shell script using nano

nano filename 

#!/bin/bash

# convert all BAM to SAM in the current directory

for file in ./*.bam
	do 
	echo $file 
	samtools view -h $file > ${file/.bam/.sam}
	done

# save changes: ctrl+O exit: ctrl+x(+shift)

1.2 Compile shell script to be able to execute
chmod +x filename

1.3 Run shell script
./filename

2. Use htseq-count to generate the count matrix for SAM files

# first download the gtf(gff2)/gff3 file from Ensembl for the species

#!/bin/bash

for file in ./bam/*.sam
	do 
	echo $file
	htseq-count $file ./Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.91.gtf > ${file/.sam/.txt}
	done
