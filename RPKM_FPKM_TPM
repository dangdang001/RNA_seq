A good refernce for undestanding the 3 normalization methods in processing RNA-seq count matrix: RPKM, FPKM and TPM

1. RPKM

1) Count up the total reads in a sample and divide that number by 1,000,000 – this is our “per million” scaling factor.
2) Divide the read counts by the “per million” scaling factor. This normalizes for sequencing depth, giving you reads per million (RPM)
3) Divide the RPM values by the length of the gene, in kilobases. This gives you RPKM.

2. FPKM 

RPKM was made for single-end RNA-seq, FPKM was made for paired-end RNA-seq. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads can correspond to a single
fragment, or, if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment. The only difference between RPKM and FPKM
is that FPKM takes into account that two reads can map to one fragment (and so it doesn’t count this fragment twice).

3. TPM 

1) Divide the read counts by the length of each gene in kilobases. This gives you reads per kilobase (RPK).
2) Count up all the RPK values in a sample and divide this number by 1,000,000. This is your “per million” scaling factor.
3) Divide the RPK values by the “per million” scaling factor. This gives you TPM.

when calculating TPM, the only difference is that you normalize for gene length first, and then normalize for sequencing depth second.
When you use TPM, the sum of all TPMs in each sample are the same. This makes it easier to compare the proportion of reads that mapped
to a gene in each sample. In contrast, with RPKM and FPKM, the sum of the normalized reads in each sample may be different, and this 
makes it harder to compare samples directly.
